SimpleShare is a lightweight and efficient file-sharing application that allows you to send and receive files either within the same local network or across different networks. Whether you're sharing files at home, in the office, or remotely, SimpleShare ensures fast and flexible transfers with the option to enhance security when needed.

1. Select Mode: Send or Receive

Upon launching the app, you can choose to:
- Send files to another device
- Receive files from another device

2. Network Mode Options

You can share files in two different network configurations:
- Same Network: Devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi or local area network.
- Different Networks: Devices are on separate networks (e.g., home and mobile data, or two different Wi-Fi connections).

Security Settings for Same Network Transfers

When using SimpleShare on the same network, you can choose:
- Encrypted Transfer (SSL): Uses a secure protocol (SSL) to encrypt your files during transfer.

You can select your preferred option before initiating the transfer.
